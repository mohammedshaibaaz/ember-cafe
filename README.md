# EMBER CAFE
## Where Slow Mornings Meet Warm Conversations

A Brooklyn coffee shop website built around one simple idea: 
creating spaces where people pause, connect, and actually taste their coffee.

## THE PHILOSOPHY

Ember Cafe exists as a response to fast spaces.

Most people rush through mornings. We designed a website (and a cafe) 
where that changes.

What you'll find here:
- Intentionally sourced coffee
- Food made by people who care
- Space designed for presence
- No rushing. No noise. Just moments.

## THE MENU (SIMPLIFIED)

Coffee
- House Blend - $5 (chocolate notes, smooth)
- Single Origin Espresso - $4 (Ethiopian, floral, bright)
- Cortado - $5.50 (espresso + velvety milk)
- Flat White - $6 (espresso + microfoam)

Food
- Morning Pastry - $4.50 (butter, almond, chocolate)
- Seasonal Plate - $9 (fresh, local, intentional)

Seasonal
- Menu rotates with local ingredients
- Chef changes things based on what's good
- Always something new to discover

## WHY THIS CAFE MATTERS

In a world of chains and apps, Ember Cafe represents something different:

What's Intentional:
- Coffee sourced with care
- Food tasted before it's served
- Space designed for comfort
- Light that matches the mood
- Sound that allows conversation
- Temperature that feels right

What's Not:
- No corporate energy
- No aggressive marketing
- No "maximize throughput" mentality
- No app required
- No rush

## THE SPACE

Not just a cafe. An invitation.

Interior:
- Warm wooden seating
- Natural light from windows
- Equipment on display (espresso machine visible)
